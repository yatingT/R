#Vector: a column of a table, same type, easy indexing

#List: a row of a table, different type, complicated indexing

#Double check the loaded variables after reading the files!

#Double check the contents of the files after writing the files!

#NULL, NA, etc. needs some special treatments.

#Sorting a table by order() is a very important technique.

#Trial and error is always strongly recommended!
