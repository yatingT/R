##############################Data Frame##############################
#################a list of vectors with the same size#################
##a table with each row being a list and each column being a vector###
#!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!IMPORTANT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

#an example

mtcars #built-in data.frame, like a spreadsheet.
       #Each row is a list, representing an observation, a type of car (all the data collected from a sample)
       #Each column is a vector, representing a variable (all the data collected for one type of measure)
data() #show all the built-in datasets
?mtcars #always use ? to get help
str(mtcars)
mtcars$cyl #cyl column, which is laid down to save space
head(mtcars) #first few rows. Useful for a too long dataset
summary(mtcars) #VS (V-shaped, like v6 or v8 vs Straight engine), am are categoric data
                #The summaries make sense for ONLY the numerical data by default!


#factor for categorical data

m <- mtcars; m #a copy of mtcars. You can see its value in Environment pane by slicking a "form" button.
m$vs <- factor(mtcars$vs, labels = c("V", "straight")) #add a factor for vs, levels = c("0", "1") by default
m                                                      #check its value
m$am <- factor(mtcars$am, levels = c("0", "1", "2"), labels = c("auto", "manual", "CVT")) #add a factor for am
                                                                                       #add level "2" and label "CVT" for possible expansion
m                                                                                      #CVT means continuously variable transmission
str(m)
summary(m) #correct summary for categorical data in vs and am (like counting => proportions)


#table

table(m$vs, m$am) #contingency table


#manipulation a data frame by indexing
#!IMPORTANT

#one single row/column

m[1] #1st (mpg) column, which is upright
m[2,] #2nd row

m$vs <- NULL; head(m) #remove vs column. Why not NA?

#!sort the data frame by the values of some columns
#!using the order to tie each column

sorted <- m[order(m$cyl, m$disp), ] #sort m by using the order and keep the connections

#quick introduction to linear regression model
# y ~ x indicates that y depends linearly on x (simple linear regression model)
# y ~ x1 + x2 + x3 + x1*x2 indicates that y depends linearly on x1, x2, x3, and x1 times x2 (multiple linear regression model)
