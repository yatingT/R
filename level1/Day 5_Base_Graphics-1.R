head(mtcars)

#boxplot(x) makes a boxplot from vector x.
boxplot(mtcars$mpg, main = "Gas mileage", ylab = "miles per gallon", ylim = c(0,40)) #a boxplot
boxplot(mtcars$mpg)

#boxplot(x ~ g) groups by factor g.
boxplot(mpg ~ factor(cyl), data = mtcars, xlab = "cylinders", ylab = "miles per gallon") #several boxplots by factors


#stripchart(x, method = "overplot") makes a dot plot of x (better than boxplot for small sample).
stripchart(mtcars$cyl[1:10], method = "jitter")

#stripchart(): dot plot, good for small sample.
stripchart(mpg ~ factor(am), data = mtcars, method = "stack")
stripchart(mpg ~ factor(am), data = mtcars) #method = "overplot" by default


#hist(x, breaks="Sturges", freq=NULL) makes a histogram from x,
#where breaks is a vector of bin boundaries (or, as in the default "Sturges", the name of a bin algorithm)
#and freq = FALSE gives density histogram instead of frequency.
hist(mtcars$mpg)
hist(mtcars$mpg, xlab = "Gas mileage (mpg)", sub = "Hello", cex.axis = 2, cex.main = .5, cex.sub = 1.5)

hist(mtcars$mpg) #default breaks is preferred!
hist(mtcars$mpg, breaks = seq(10, 35, by = 0.1)) #too pricky
hist(mtcars$mpg, breaks = seq(10, 35, length.out = 4)) #too bulky
#Conclusion: Usually, let R choose the breaks for you automatically. 

hist(mtcars$mpg, freq = F) #density histogram, not frequency histogram


#plot(x, y) makes a scatterplot from vectors x and y
x = 1:5; y = 2*x; plot(x, y)
plot(x, y, xlim = c(0,10), ylim = c(0,10)) #change the scale of x & y-axis


#points(x, y) adds points to a plot
#lines(x, y) adds line segments
#!ONLY adding, not openning a new plot
dev.off() #clear all the plots
points(x, x, pch = 15) #error messages! Why?

plot(x, y, xlim = c(0,10), ylim = c(0,10)) #open and draw a plot
points(x, x, pch = 15) #add a line
?points #pch = 15 means solid squares
lines(x = c(1,3,5,7,9), y = c(8,1,4,1,8), col = "red") #color is red


#plot(density(x))
#KDE (Kernel Density Estimation), a usually better estimate of pdf than the histogram
#For more details, check https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_density_estimation
plot(density(mtcars$mpg)) #draw a KDE
rug(mtcars$mpg) #add the data points

d <- density(mtcars$mpg)
str(d)


#pairs(x) makes a matrix of scatterplots of pairs of columns of data frame x
pairs(mtcars) #check the pairwise relationship of mtcars


#curve(expr, from=NULL, to=NULL, n=101, add=FALSE, type="l") draws a curve of expr over [from, to] 
curve(expr = x*sin(1/x), from = -pi/6, to = pi/6, n = 200) #n = 200 is good
curve(expr = x*sin(1/x), from = -pi/6, to = pi/6, n = 10) #n = 10 is too low and the graph is incorrect

curve(expr = x*sin(1/x), from = -pi/6, to = pi/6, n = 200)
curve(expr = x*1, add = TRUE, col = "red") #add = TRUE means adding to existing plot
curve(expr = x*(-1), add = TRUE, col = "red") #a good example in Calculus I to illustrate the squeeze theorem of limits


###############################legends##############################

#legend(x, y, legend, col=par("col"), lty, pch) makes a legend at (x, y)
?legend
#x, y:      location
#legend:    label
#col:       color
#lty:       line type
#pch:       plotting character

#If there is some proportional issues, zoom the plot first

##########################categorical data##########################

#barplot(height, names.arg = NULL) makes a barplot of the counts in height, with (optional) bar labels in names.arg
#A barplot is not a histogram!
#check http://stattrek.com/statistics/charts/histogram.aspx?Tutorial=AP
mtcars$cyl
counts = table(mtcars$cyl); counts
barplot(counts)
barplot(mtcars$cyl) #wrong without counting first!

#mosaicplot(x) makes a mosaic plot from a table of counts from table()
counts = table(mtcars$cyl, mtcars$gear); counts
mosaicplot(counts) #kind of transposed, compared with the contingency table

##################write graphical output to a file##################

#step 1. Open a graphical output file with
#pdf("file.pdf"): file.*** is your destination filename
#png("file.png")
#jpeg("file.jpg")
#bmp("file.bmp")
#postscript("file.ps")
#tiff("file.tif")
pdf("junk.pdf")

#step 2. Make graph
x = rnorm(100)
plot(density(x))

#step 3. Close the file with
dev.off()

#open junk.pdf to check the graph.


#################################HW3################################

#Download hw3.Rmd
#Double check its suffix after saving it into your working directory
#The suffix MUST be .Rmd, instead of .rmd!

#Read the comments carefully
#Then, fill in all the blanks as required

#please surround your English text with doubled asterisks (`**...**`)
#to highlight them. Then, it is easy for our grader to find your text.

#You can try to knit your .Rmd file into .html file to double check
#your output. Then, just submit your .Rmd file. We will generate
#your .html from your submission.


############################Summary#################################

#Know how to use R Markdown (as well as LaTeX) for HW3 and HW4.

#How to plot a graph is a very important technique.

#Plotting looks like complicated. You'd better learn it with some examples. Also, try it yourself.

#Go over some statistics to improve the understanding of all kinds of plots.
